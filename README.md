# 👥 HR Analytics & Attrition Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, leading to significant knowledge loss and increased hiring costs. This project leverages **Microsoft Power BI** for visual storytelling and **Machine Learning** to identify key drivers of employee turnover.

The dashboard provides an interactive view of workforce dynamics, helping HR departments move from reactive hiring to **proactive retention strategies**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Power BI**: Used for creating the interactive dashboard and visualizing KPIs.
* **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Used for predictive modeling and data analysis.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
* **Scikit-Learn**: For building the attrition prediction model.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
* **Attrition by Demographics**: Breakdown of turnover by Age, Gender, and Education level.
* **Departmental Analysis**: Deep dive into specific departments (e.g., Sales, R&D) to pinpoint high-risk teams.
* **Key Risk Factors**: Visual correlation between attrition and factors like **Overtime**, **Salary Slabs**, and **Years Since Last Promotion**.

## 📉 Model Performance & Evidence
To ensure the reliability of the attrition predictions, a Machine Learning model was trained and evaluated.

## 1. Confusion Matrix
Displays the model's accuracy in correctly classifying employees as "At Risk" vs. "Safe".

## 2. Feature Importance
Highlights the top factors contributing to employee churn (e.g., Overtime, Monthly Income).

## 🧠 Key Insights from Analysis
* **Overtime Impact**: Employees working frequent overtime showed a significantly higher likelihood of leaving.
* **Career Stagnation**: A strong correlation was observed between lack of promotions (in the last 3-4 years) and attrition.
* **Income Sensitivity**: Lower salary slabs exhibited higher churn rates, suggesting a need for compensation review.
